fullstack blog. vue frontend node backend

beginnings of a blog/portfolio/meme app

learning vue so i used a vue frontend, and a node.js backend. there's no authentication yet and not a lot of cool vue stuff.

to run cd into api and run server.js
then build/run the frontend

also you need a db.js file with an exported object containing a mongodb uri
